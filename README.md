# Regex Toolbox

Regular expression tools for JavaScript developers.


## RegexBuilder

`RegexBuilder` is a class for building regular expressions in a more human-readable way using a fluent API. It offers a number of benefits over using raw regex syntax in strings:

 - No knowledge of regular expression syntax is required: just use simple, intuitively-named classes and methods.
 - Code is easier to read, understand and maintain.
 - Code is safer and far less prone to regular expression syntax errors and programmer errors.

It is fully documented in the [project wiki](https://github.com/markwhitaker/RegexToolbox.JS/wiki).
